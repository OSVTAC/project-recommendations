## 3. Facts & Assumptions

This section lists certain facts and assumptions the committee has made while
drafting this document.


### 3.1. Facts

1. The Director of Elections' [March 2017 Director's
   Report][directors-report-march-2017-original] began outlining characteristics of
   the development plan for the open-source voting system. These included—

   * For the system to be "Developed under version 3 of the GNU General
     Public License where possible, otherwise preferring similar licenses
     with copyleft characteristics." This is consistent with the
     recommendation in the Commission’s Open Source Voting Systems Resolution
     in its third "resolved" paragraph:
     > (d) Express a preference for open source licenses
     with copyleft characteristics so that San Francisco and other
     jurisdictions can benefit from future improvements that others make to
     the voting system components;

   * To post the software developed for the new system "as it is written."
     This is also consistent with the recommendations in the same "resolved"
     paragraph of the Commission's resolution:
     > (b) Incorporate openness and transparency into the project, for
     example ... by releasing all development products, including software
     source code and documentation, as they are developed;


### 3.2. Assumptions

1. The Department of Elections does not currently have the expertise to
   conduct the day-to-day management of the development and certification of
   an open source voting system.

2. The voting system should not require counting the votes on ballots by
   hand (not including hand-counting for audit or recount purposes).
