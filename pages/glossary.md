* **EIMS®**. [EIMS®](http://www.dfmassociates.com/eims.asp) is the software
  application that the Department of Elections uses for certain
  election-related functions like maintaining voter registration data,
  administering polling place information, defining ballot styles, and
  tracking candidate filings for office (see
  [Appendix A][dfm-contract-appendix-a] of the City's contract with DFM for
  a detailed listing of the required capabilities).
  The Department signed a nine-year contract
  with [DFM Associates](http://www.dfmassociates.com) for the software
  in June 2011 ([DFM contract][dfm-contract-main],
  [Appendix A][dfm-contract-appendix-a],
  [Appendix B][dfm-contract-appendix-b],
  [Appendix C][dfm-contract-appendix-c],
  [Appendix D][dfm-contract-appendix-d],
  [Appendix E][dfm-contract-appendix-e]). The contract lists the per-year
  maintenance and support costs as ranging between $170,820.00 and
  $274,299.60 (see [Appendix D][dfm-contract-appendix-d] of the contract
  for more detail).
