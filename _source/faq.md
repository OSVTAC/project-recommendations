## 5. FAQ

**1. Is open-source software more or less secure than proprietary
software?**

Independent studies have shown that, in general, open-source software is
neither more secure nor less secure than proprietary software (see for
example Synopsys's ["CoverityÂ® Scan Open Source Report
2014"][coverity-report-2014]). Both secure and insecure open-source software
can be written. Similarly, both secure and insecure proprietary software can
be written.

A key difference though is that, because it is publicly viewable, claims
about the security of open-source software can be _independently verified_,
and by _anyone_ (provided they have the necessary skills and time). With
proprietary code, such claims can be based only on trusting those who are
able to view the code.

The security of a given piece of software is primarily a function of how well
the software is written. It does not (and should not) depend on keeping the
code secret. The idea that software can be made secure by keeping it secret
is an idea known as "security by obscurity" and is widely rejected in the
security community.

Open source is already heavily used and relied upon throughout the world for
security-critical applications. For example, much of the code that allows
the secure transmission of information over the internet is open source.

**2. How can members of the public be sure that the open-source code is
what is actually running on the machine?**

**3. How much of the code must be open source for the voting system to
be considered open source?**
