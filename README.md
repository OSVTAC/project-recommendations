# Open Source Voting System Project Recommendations

This repository contains the source files for the approved recommendations of
San Francisco's [Open Source Voting System Technical Advisory
Committee][osvtac] (OSVTAC, or TAC) for the City and County of San
Francisco's open source voting system project.

You can view the most recent rendered version of the recommendations
[here][recommendations-rendered], and you can see a history of all changes
[here][recommendations-history].

To provide comments to the committee, you can open an issue on the
repository's [issue tracker][recommendations-issues]. To suggest specific
wording for some portion of the document, you can open a pull request
[here][recommendations-pulls]. Alternatively, you can email your feedback to
the committee. Contact information for the committee can be found on the
committee's [About page][osvtac-about].

The committee may discuss and/or vote on your suggestions at a future
meeting. **To be considered for the next meeting, please submit suggestions
at least 10 days before the date of the next meeting.** This time is needed
to prepare the agenda.

Because of San Francisco's [Sunshine Ordinance] and other
open government laws, the committee is limited in how it can collaborate
outside of meetings on committee matters. Committee members are able to see
and read your comments and suggestions, but they cannot necessarily respond
publicly as individuals.
