# Open Source Voting System Project Recommendations

This repository contains the source files for the approved recommendations of
San Francisco's [Open Source Voting System Technical Advisory
Committee][osvtac] (OSVTAC, or TAC) for the City and County of San
Francisco's open source voting system project.

You can view the most recent rendered version of the recommendations
[here][recommendations-rendered], and you can see a history of all changes
[here][recommendations-history].

To provide comments to the committee, you can email your feedback. Contact
information for the committee can be found on the committee's [About
page][osvtac-about].

Alternatively, if you have a GitHub account, you can open an issue on the
repository's [issue tracker][recommendations-issues]. If you are familiar
with Git and [Markdown][markdown], you can also suggest specific wording by
opening a pull request [here][recommendations-pulls]. Information on
preparing a pull request can be found in the repository's
[`CONTRIBUTE`](CONTRIBUTE.md) file.

The committee may discuss and/or vote on your suggestions at a future
meeting. **To be considered for the next meeting, please submit suggestions
at least 10 days before the date of the next meeting.** This time is needed
to prepare the agenda.

Because of San Francisco's [Sunshine Ordinance] and other
open government laws, the committee is limited in how it can collaborate
outside of meetings on committee matters. Committee members are able to see
and read your comments and suggestions, but they cannot necessarily respond
publicly as individuals.
